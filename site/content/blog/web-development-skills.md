## Must have Web Development Skills

There are many paths into web development.

When I started out I spent thousands of pounds on courses because I wanted to get into IT. What I did not know is that I was on the completely wrong path.

I started out with a Microsoft course and very quickly realise I had bitten off more than I could chew.

It was only years later when I took a basic CIW (Certified Internet Webmaster) course whihc helped lay the foundations for the correct path.

I did not want to be a software developer, I wanted to design websites.
