## I don't have all the skills, but i get by!

I have worked professionally for the same agency for around 8 years. I have barely touched javascript. It's a shame as I would love to dig deep into the language and produce my own software.

This is one of the reasons I moved to Hugo, it means I can push myself to learn new things. With Wordpress its too easy to push a button or use a builder. 

You can of course choose not to use builders, and you can use plugins to disable things. You can even not use plugins and dig into the functions.php file

But I wanted something simpler for Pixaful. I wanted to challenge myself with a new language. You could argue that GO templating isn't a language. Go is the language and I am using a particular part of it to achierve my goals. I also cannot programme in C but i can create a skin in DNN. And I do not know PHP but I can create my own wordpress theme.

You don't have to know these languages to build epic websites, but it does not mean that you shouldn't try to pick up a langage here and there. I suggest Javascript :)
