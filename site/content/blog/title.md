So we are in the process of moving our portfolio website to Hugo. Having seen what Smashing Magazine achieved, we wanted a piece of that. Plus it gives us the chance to brush up on our development skills.

Whilst I love Wordpress, I do find myself being propped up by the likes of Elementor and Beaver Builder.  They have their use cases, especially for clients on a budget that need websites built quickly. Thei is of course a comprise between design and code. The output of a pagebuidler a garbage, no matter which one you use.
