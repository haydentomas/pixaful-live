**So you discovered Hugo know you should be using it, after all whats not to love!**

Clean code and a fast loading website with no database to take care of, or get hacked. Don't get me wrong, I love wordpress. Its a freelancers dream machine and it puts food on the table, but sometimes it feels like i am taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

I have tried other systems as I chased the holy grail of speed and efficiency for my websites and the closest I came to finding it was through CraftCMS. Its was nice but even that broke on me with a database fail. 

Hugo on the other hand I can handle for small jobs.

I am writing this post using Forestry.io. It gives you a CMS that you can attach to your static site, everything is backed up through github and I am using gitkraken for helping with the version control.

Truth be told, you do not have to be a top seeded developer to maintain a hugo website.

**Oh, and the best part is that you can host these sites for free on netlify!**
