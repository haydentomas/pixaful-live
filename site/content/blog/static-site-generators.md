## Building a static website is totally worth it

Usually I am rolling WordPress. I am not a fan of it personally, but my clients are and they pay my bills. I am however a pan of PHP and can make WordPress do anything I need to. You can use a few plugins to get rid of the junk for a boilerplate setup and your good to go.

That being said, static site builders have always intrigued me.

1. Can I build a website in HUGO quicker than I can in WordPress?
2. Can I build it in such a way that can be managed by a client?

So far, although it is very much a work in progress I can say yes!

My clients are local businesses. They don't ask for much. Mostly static pages with a contact form. For these clients I can certainly say yes to static websites. Moreover I am usually the one doing the updates.

The clients that prefer to manage their websites are usually e-commerce clients and then I use Wordpress or Magento.

## The benefits of static websites

1. **Speed** - Database driven websites need to make a call to the database before a page is served, this takes time as the pages do not actually exist until they are required.
2. **Security** - No database means, no hacks! Static websites can be managed using markdown files and then compiled, for the less tech savvy you can attach a headless cms like forestry which lives on a different server.
3. **Scalability** -  Hugo can build thousands of pages in seconds, it is the fastest static site generator available.

## What are the downsides of a static site generator?

Static websites present data that does not change much, they are not dynamic which means if you are looking to build the next Facebook or perhaps an e-commerce website with configurable products, then a static website is not for you.

If you want a portfolio, blog or a basic brochure website then I can say that ANY cms is overkill.

## But I want to create pages through a CMS

Your fine! Netlify has its own CMS which connects to Hugo, and I personally use [Forestry](https://forestry.io)

## What about data driven forms?

You can build your own forms and add a special tag through netlify that will send the forms for you, there are dozens of providers that specialise in static site forms. You are not alone!

## I want visitors to be able to search my site, isn't that a dynamic feature?

Indeed it is, usually. But you can add site search features to  a static website. You can use Google custom search or take a look at my own website where I have implemented a javascript search that works very well indeed!

This article is a work in progress.
