## Search Engine Optimisation services for local businesses

If you run a local business and have a website, then you will need to be visible on the web so that your clients can find you.

As a website developer,part of my job is to ensure that every website I create is SEO ready when I hand it over to my client. 

That means ensuring that:

<ul>
<li>Ensuring that page titles optimised</li>
<li>On-page content has the right amount of keywords and phrases</li>
<li>Images have alt tags</li>
<li>Twitter and Open Graph cards are filled in for every page</li>
<li>Checking the site for dead links</li>
<li>Making sure the site loads nice and fast!</li>
</ul>

This is basic level on-page seo that every web developer should be able to do, and it's also where my job ends in SEO as I am more suited to building websites than optimising them. 

I have teamed up with a UK based SEO expert, and they are ready to take your local business to the next level.
